## AMBIENT EVENTS
Ambient events utilize peds and vehicles that already exist in the world; nothing is spawned.  Certain events only use specific peds or peds with specific properties/attributes, which means if the necessary peds are not present when the event is trying to start, the event will not happen. This does not mean the event is broken.

* **Assault** - Does not use specific peds.  You can experience this event anywhere.
* **Carjacking** - Does not use specific peds.  You can experience this event anywhere.
* **Drug Deal** - Uses Grove, Balla, and Vagos peds.  You'll come across this event in areas where these peds exist.
* **Drive-by** - Uses Grove, Balla, and Vagos peds.  You'll come across this event in areas where these peds exist.
* **Prostitution** - Uses hooker peds.  You'll come across this event at night in areas where these peds exist.

Minor events can happen every 1-3 minutes.  Currently they are always on and it is not possible to toggle them off individually.
* **Broken Light** - A vehicle will have a broken headlight or tail light.
* **No Vehicle Lights** - A vehicle will have no lights on (night time only).
* **Broken Windshield** - A vehicle will have a broken windshield.
* **Reckless Driver** - A vehicle will be seen driving recklessly around other vehicles.
* **Speeding** - A vehicle will be seen driving faster than other vehicles.
